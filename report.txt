Homework 2
* All code is run using C++11 *
* Run make in the directory to compile the driver file *
* All questions are answered using the driver executable *

2.  To run, type ./driver and follow the given instructions. In
    this assignment, you will enter:
        >global
        >fasta/fruitfly.fasta
        >fasta/human.fasta
        >2 -1 -2
    Result: -1016

3.  To run, type ./driver and follow the given instructions. In
    this assignment, you will enter:
        >local
        >fasta/fruitfly.fasta
        >fasta/human.fasta
        >2 -1 -2
    Result: 820

4.  To run, type ./driver and follow the given instructions. In
    this assignment, you will enter:
        >endgapfree
        >fasta/human_mito.fasta
        >fasta/neander_sample.fasta
        >2 -1 -2
    Result: 620

5.  Blasting the two sequences gave an alignment with a length of
    1269. There were also two alignments, one of
    length 399 with 2 gaps and 293/399 identity matches, and
    another of length 204 with 0 gaps and 145/204 identity matches.
    The e-value of the result was 4e-65.
    The resulting alignment from blast was confusing to me, as I
    couldn't find the resulting sequences in the given .fasta files.
    The sequences were also fairly shorter than mine, making me think
    my local alignment may have been too long.


6.  Blastn resulted in a 100% match to
        Homo sapiens sonic hedgehog (SHH), RefSeqGene on chromosome 7
        Homo sapiens BAC clone RP11-69O3 from 7, complete sequence
        Human cosmid clone LL157A05 from 7q36, complete sequence
    I can only assume that these are all the same sequences with different
    naming conventions.
    Blastx's top result was
    Select seq XP_011514781.1	PREDICTED: sonic hedgehog protein isoform X1 [Homo sapiens]
    This sequence had two matching ranges. The first had 275/277 matches, the
    second 88/89. Neither of these ranges had any gaps.
